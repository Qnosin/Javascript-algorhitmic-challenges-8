## Javascript algorhitmic challenges #8
eighth exercise of my 100 chalenges in 30 days!!
* This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

* Examples:
```
seven(times(five())); // must return 35
four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3

```

*Requirements:

```
* There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby and Python)
* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
*  Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:
```

	
## How to see the results of my solution?
there are 2 ways
* first : install nodeJS for your os from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and type in terminal or cmd 'node script.js'
* second : copy the file to the javascript tab on https://jsbin.com/?html,js,console,output and see the output in the console tab.
